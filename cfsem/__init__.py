def self_inductance_piecewise_linear_filaments(xyzp: Array3xN) -> float:
    """
    Estimate the self-inductance of one piecewise-linear current filament.

    Uses Neumann's Formula for the mutual inductance of arbitrary loops
    for non-self-pairings, zeroes-out the contributions from self-pairings
    to resolve the thin-filament self-inductance singularity, and replaces the
    segment self-inductance term with an analytic value from [3].

    Assumes:

    * Thin, well-behaved filaments
    * Uniform current distribution within segments
        * Low frequency operation; no skin effect
          (which would reduce the segment self-field term)
    * Vacuum permeability everywhere
    * Each filament has a constant current in all segments
      (otherwise we need an inductance matrix)

    Calculation of a distributed conductor's self-inductance from two components:

    * External inductance: the portion related to the poloidal flux exactly at the conductor edge
    * Internal inductance: the portion related to the poloidal magnetic field inside the conductor,
      where the filamentized method used for coils does not apply due to the parallel arrangement
      and variable current density.

    Note: the B-field and flux inputs are _not_ the total from all sources - they are only the
    contribution from the distributed conductor under examination.

    This calculation was developed for use with tokamak plasmas, but applies similarly to
    other kinds of distributed axisymmetric conductor.

    Assumptions:

    * Cylindrically-symmetric, distributed, single-winding, contiguous conductor
    * No high-magnetic-permeability materials in the vicinity
    * Isopotential on the edge contour
        * This is slightly less restrictive than isopotential on the section,
          but notably does _not_ allow the calc to be used with, for example,
          large, shell conductors where different regions are meaningfully
          independent of each other.
    * Conductor interior does not touch the edge of the computational domain
        * At least one grid cell of padding is needed to support finite differences
