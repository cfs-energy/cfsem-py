![Helmholtz coil example](python/example_outputs/helmholtz.png)

Above is the B-field of a Helmholtz coil, calculated with cfsem.
On the left, the red dashes outline where the B-field magnitude is within 1% of its value at (r=0, z=0), and the black dots show where the coils intersect the r-z plane.
